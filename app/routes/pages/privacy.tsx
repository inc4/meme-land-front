        Introduction
        <br/>
        This website, <a href="https://memedrop.ai" className="underline">https://memedrop.ai</a> (the "Website"), is owned and operated by Solber Solution INC, a company duly incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Panama ("we," "our," or "us"). We value your privacy and are committed to being transparent about how we collect, use, and safeguard the information you provide or that we gather automatically when you interact with the Website and related services (collectively, the "Services").
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>By using the Website, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to this Privacy Policy and our Terms and Conditions. If you do not agree, please refrain from using the Website or submitting any information.</p>
    <p>We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The "Last Updated" date indicates the latest changes. Continued use of the Website implies your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.</p>

      <li>
        Your Security
        <br/>
        We use commercially reasonable safeguards to protect any personal information ("Personal Information") that may be collected, including physical, electronic, and administrative measures such as access controls, encryption, and staff training.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>However, no system is entirely secure. By using the Website, you acknowledge that any data transmission is at your own risk, and we are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy or security measures.</p>

      <li>
        Information We Collect
        <br/>
        We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>The only data collected is anonymous, aggregated usage data via Google Analytics cookies. These help us understand site traffic trends—such as page visits, device types, and time spent—without identifying individual users. You can control or delete these cookies through your browser.</p>
    <p>We do not collect or process names, emails, wallet addresses, IPs tied to users, or payment data.</p>

      <li>
        How We Use Information
        <br/>

      <li>Monitor general traffic trends and platform performance</li>
      <li>Improve the overall user experience</li>
      <li>Evaluate the impact of marketing efforts (e.g., number of visits)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not use this data to identify users or for automated decision-making.</p>
    <ol start={5}>
      <li>
        Sharing of Data
        <br/>
        Since we do not collect identifiable personal data, there is nothing to sell or trade.

    </ol>
    <p>We may share aggregated, anonymized statistics with third-party providers (e.g., Google Analytics) to analyze overall usage patterns.</p>
    <p>If required by law or regulation, we may disclose anonymized data to authorities, although we hold no personal data.</p>

      <li>
        Targeted Advertising & Analytics
        <br/>
