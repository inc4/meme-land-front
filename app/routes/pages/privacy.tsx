We do not share your Personal Data with third parties without your consent, except as described in this Privacy Notice or as otherwise required or permitted by applicable law. We may share your Personal Data within our group, and with affiliates, for purposes consistent with this Privacy Notice.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      We may share your Personal Data with third party companies and individuals that provide services on our behalf or help us operate the Site or our business. These third parties may use your Personal Data only as directed or authorised by us and in a manner consistent with this Privacy Notice, and are prohibited from using or disclosing your information for any other purpose.

      <br/>
      We may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of our business or assets, including your Personal Data, in connection with a business transaction (or potential business transaction) such as a corporate divestiture, merger, consolidation, acquisition, reorganisation or sale of assets, or in the event of bankruptcy or dissolution.
    </p>
    <h3>Retention of Personal Data</h3>
    <p>
      We will retain your Personal Data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, accounting, or reporting requirements. We determine data retention based on the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from an unauthorised user, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and applicable legal requirements.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance of a contract between you and us will be retained until such contract has been fully performed. Personal Data collected for our legitimate interests will be retained as long as needed to fulfil such purposes.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      We may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever you have given consent to such processing, as long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, we may be obliged to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to do so for the performance of a legal obligation or upon order of an authority.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Once the retention period expires, Personal Data will be deleted (or, where permitted under applicable law, may be de-identified instead). Therefore, the right of access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability (where relevant under applicable law) cannot be enforced after expiration of the retention period.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      However not all your Personal Data may be able to be deleted or de-identified; see the section of this Privacy Notice on "Blockchain transactions", below.
